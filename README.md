What really motivated me to learn DevOps, is the monetary aspect, also DevOps covers the whole software development life cycle.  As a DevOps engineer you can have a huge business impact in your company by having a good understanding of the whole software development life cycle and improving and optimizing it. And this again can be super fulfilling to know that your work has such an impact and affects many people eventually.
